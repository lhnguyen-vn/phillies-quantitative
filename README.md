This repository contains a sample [analysis proposal](https://github.com/lhnguyen-vn/phillies-quantitative/main/proposal.pdf) and batting average prediction code for the Phillies Baseball quantitative analyst questionnaire. The language used is Julia, and for convenience the code is published in a Jupyter notebook. The easiest way to access the code is to launch the repo with Binder via the badge above. If you want to run the notebook locally, the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files are included to specify the exact package versions used for reproducibility.
